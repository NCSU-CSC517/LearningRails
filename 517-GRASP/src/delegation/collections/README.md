# Delegation Example - collections

## Description
In this example, an AlwaysSortedArrayList class maintains an array list of strings, and ensures that after any alteration operation the list is returned to a sorted state. It delegates most operations to ArrayList, but adds a Collections.sort operation when needed, similar to a decorator.
