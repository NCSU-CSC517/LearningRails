## Description
* In this example, factory method for validation of post code is created, but incomplete.

* Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
* The class is chosen at run time.
* Creates object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common
  interface.
* Allows to encapsulate object creation so that all object creation code can be kept at one place.
