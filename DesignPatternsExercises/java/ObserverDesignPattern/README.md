# Observer Design Pattern

## Exercise
To share exercise with students, provide them with content of the `Exercise/` directory.
### Import Exercise into CS50 Sandbox
To create exercise in the CS50 Sandbox, please follow the steps below:
* Create new [CS50 Sandbox](https://sandbox.cs50.io)
* Drag and drop ALL files from `Exercise/` directory
  * No need to change/modify any files
  * Keep hierarchical structure of `Exercise/` directory as is
* Set the model for the new CS50 Sandbox
* Get sharable link and share it with students in the corresponding Google form

## Solution
To test, view, and share solution for the exercise see content of the `Solution/` directory. No need to change content
of the `Solution/` directory.
