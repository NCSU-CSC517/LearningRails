# This is Command Design Pattern Exercise in Ruby
## Description
* In this example, extracting tool of the file is created, but incomplete.
* The concept here is exactly same as strategy pattern example you saw earlier, but of course, some implementation
changes as per Command design pattern.
* The correct extraction algorithm needs to be called in a way that reflects use of command design pattern.
* To match the "correct" answers, if some method takes a file parameter, name the parameter a.csv, b.xx, c.xx, etc.,
where "xx" is the correct file extension.
* You need to fill in the '__________________' blanks to complete the code.
* Start with command_pattern.rb file.

## Run the program
To execute the program from command line, please run the following command:

```
ruby command_pattern.rb
```

## What needs to be done
* Please fill in the '__________________'  blanks to make the program run successfully to follow Command Pattern.
* Check each file for blanks.
* Enter missing statements (blanks) into Google Doc Exercise.

## Expected Output
Upon executing the program, you should see the following output:

```
Extracting as CSV...
Extracting as TSV...
Extracting as database...
```

### Hint
Extraction interface is analogous to command interface and subsequent concrete classes are analogous to concrete command
