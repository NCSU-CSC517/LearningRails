# Learning Rails
This repository is mainly for [CSC/ECE 517] class use at the NCSU.

## Description
The repository contains combined contributions of individual students who developed Java and Ruby in-class programming exercises, problems, and examples that are part of the CSC/ECE 517 (Object-Oriented Design and Development) curriculum. It contains multiple repositories that were cloned from different locations.

## Source Code
This section describes how and from where some of the source code has been cloned.
### Cloned Repositories
Some directories located in this repository were cloned from their original repositories to integrate all the CSC/ECE in-class exercises, problems, and examples into a single repository. After each individual repository was cloned, remote repository URL was changed using the following commands:
```sh
$ git remote set-url --push origin https://github.com/NSCU-CSC517/LearningRails.git
```
After remote URL was updated, the source code was pushed into this repository.
In order to verify remote URL is updated properly run the following command:
```sh
$ git remote -v
```
Below is the list of directories that were cloned as described above, authors of the source code and original repository where the code was cloned from:
